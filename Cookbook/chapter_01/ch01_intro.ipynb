    "## Technical requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "Over this book we will be working with the Plotly, and Dash Python libraries. Hence, you will require access to Python 3.10 or higher. In addition to `plotly` and `dash`, we will use `numpy`, `scipy`, and `yfinance`.\n",
    "\n",
    "While working through the examples and exercises in the book, you can, there are two options:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use an integrated development environment (IDE) such as Visual Studio Code (VS Code) or Pycharm\n",
