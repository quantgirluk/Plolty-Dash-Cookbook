## About me

I am a mathematician with over 8 years of experience working as a Quant in Finance. Currently, I am working in the Cross-Asset front office quant team at Bank of America. My  experience includes the development and implementation of mathematical models for Credit, Commodities and Rates asset classes; as well as for Counterparty Credit Risk, Market Risk, and Wholesale and Retail Credit Risk.

I hold a PhD in Mathematics/Statistics from the University of Warwick where I spent 4 amazing years focusing on non-linear stochastic processes. Before coming to the UK, I obtained an MSc in Probability and Statistics, and a BSc in Applied Mathematics in Mexico.

I regularly write [here](https://quantgirl.blog) about diverse topics.
